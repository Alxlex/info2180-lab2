  <h2>Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear</h2>
  <p>September 30, 2022 by Alex Salmon</p>
  <img id="photo" src="Kuma.jpg" alt="The Anime Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear">
  Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is an anmie under the Isekai genre. Yuna the mc of the anime,
   loves to play VRMMO World Fantasy Online a lot. Yuna is amazing at the game and bored of her life on earth
   (well that's how I see it). One day she decided on entering the VRMMO again and that is where she was transferred
   to a different load up screen than she's normally used to where she met this AI (which was a goddess) and ws asked
   if she would wanna be sent to a fantasy world with all game stats and a suit that is built to protect her and help
   her out in her future lifestyle in the fantasy world. Because of how boring her life is in the real world she accepted
   and was transferred into the new fantasy world where she encounter different problems and meet new people that will be 
   an assest to her adventures. <br>
   Which the start of Yuna's adventure you see she starts off to train her new found abilities with her new suit in the fantasy
   world that she ended up in yk. So with the get up being a literal bear onesie you see in some way shap or form all of her 
   magic attack or summoning is related to bears. Not gonna lie that is a little too cute for comfort but even so the moves she 
   excute are very effective. While training she met this girl who seems to be in a age range of 10 - 12 (I think the age was mention 
   I just don't remember) and was being attacked by some wolfs. Yuna ofcourse came to save her and she thanked Yuna and explain her situation.
   Basically she was out there finiding ways to help her mom or something that correlates with that. Which will be found out sooner than
   later and this girl (even though I can't remember her name) becomes a big part in Yuna's new life in that world.

  This anime is also under the genre of Isekai. No Game No Life started with a gameplay of a group called "Blank" fighting against a single
   player who thought they could use cheats to defeat the group blank not knowing that they plans were seen right through and was stopped immediately
   and was defeated in an instant. In the game blank is a group of four people. So you would think that the people playing would be four different person 
   right? No! You found out it was a little girl and a guy controlling the four characters and called themselves Blank because they need no name. These two
   who are siblings Sora and his younger sister Shiro. Work together by putting there strenghts in different gaming scenarios and defeat any oponent that comes
   there way. <br>
   So after that game while Shiro took a break at playing and Sora had to take control of the four characters he got a gaming challenge from a
