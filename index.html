    im
 <article>Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is an anmie under the Isekai genre. Yuna the mc of the anime,
   loves to play VRMMO World Fantasy Online a lot. Yuna is amazing at the game and bored of her life on earth
   (well that's how I see it). One day she decided on entering the VRMMO again and that is where she was transferred
   to a different load up screen than she's normally used to where she met this AI (which was a goddess) and ws asked
   if she would wanna be sent to a fantasy world with all game stats and a suit that is built to protect her and help
   her out in her future lifestyle in the fantasy world. Because of how boring her life is in the real world she accepted
   and was transferred into the new fantasy world where she encounter different problems and meet new people that will be 
   an assest to her adventures
